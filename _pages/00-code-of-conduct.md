# Code of Conduct

OceanHackWeek is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from OceanHackWeek with no refund.

OceanHackWeek organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.


## Reporting a violation
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of OceanHackWeek for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. **Anonymous reports can be made [here](https://oceanhackweek.wufoo.com/forms/zep2ybt1swlulc/).**

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.


## Group discussion
**Q: What can we do to create an optimal learning environment for everyone?**

* If you see something, say something (wrt code of conduct) -- everyone can take responsibility for supporting participants
* Push your comfort zone, ask questions from many, reach out to the room
* Stay positive
* Creating space where everyone feels comfortable asking questions
* Don’t dismiss ideas you may not fully understand;  issues are challenges
* Respect our diverse backgrounds (language, technical skills, science background; career stage)
* Putting our best selves forward
* Be present
* Everyone feels comfortable contributing
* Be mindful of everyone’s background and constraints
* Work with the person, don’t just take over their keyboard
* Opportunity for anonymous comments (also use Slack)
* Empathize, put yourself in others’ shoes
