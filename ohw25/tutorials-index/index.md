# Tutorials

We are pleased to present a number of tutorials during the week.  These tutorials provide a look into the work that your colleagues pursue using coding tools.  The software for most tutorials can be downloaded using the tools described in our [Tutorials Getting Started page](../tutorials_getting_started.md).  Please check the [schedule](../schedule.md) for the times of these presentations.

```{admonition} Technical preparations and background for OceanHackWeek!
- Please review the ["Preparation" materials](../../resources/prep/index.md) covering basic topics like `Git`, `GitHub`, `conda` package management and the OHW `JupyterHub`
- For tutorials on Python and R scientific tools and techniques that we will use in OceanHackWeek, see the [OHW 2022 tutorials page](../../ohw22/tutorials-index/index.md)!
```
