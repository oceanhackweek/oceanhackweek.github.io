# Tutorials

We are pleased to present a number of tutorials during the week.  These tutorials provide a look into the work that your colleagues pursue using coding tools.  The software for most tutorials can be downloaded using the tools described in our [Tutorials Getting Started page](../tutorials_getting_started.md).  Please check the [schedule](../schedule.md) for the times of these presentations.

```{admonition} Technical preparations and background for OceanHackWeek!
- Please review the ["Preparation" materials](../../resources/prep/index.md) covering basic topics like `Git`, `GitHub`, `conda` package management and the OHW `JupyterHub`
- For tutorials on Python and R scientific tools and techniques that we will use in OceanHackWeek, see the [OHW 2022 tutorials page](../../ohw22/tutorials-index/index.md)!
```

## Main tutorials

<!-- ```{admonition} UPDATE THIS INFORMATION TO OHW24 CONTEXT!!
:class: important
- See the [ohw23 tutorials index page](../../ohw23/tutorials-index) as a template to content for this page. 
- Make sure to update the links to tutorials in `ohw-tutorials` repo in `toctree`, and see [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/issues/263](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/issues/263) to understand the somewhat complex, git submodules set up that links to tutorials in that repo
``` -->

The following tutorials will be presented live during the **US sessions**, and will be recorded for later review.
