# Hacking at OHW24

## How will the projects be conducted?

We encourage project ideas from participants! Feel free to discuss existing or new project ideas **#ohw24_project** Slack channel prior to the event. Once ideas begin to gel and collaborative groups begin to form, the group can start getting into the weeds using a [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1lOgVwnqQLvNRPAOEVEGnWXm8FSTuPYQWbteptKrslTM/viewer?f=0) or a combination of sticky notes and whiteboards. Later, each group needs to create a project Slack channel that starts with `ohw24_proj_` (say, `ohw24_proj_upwelling`), and create a Github repository (follow [these instructions](https://oceanhackweek.org/resources/prep/git.html#create-a-project-repository)). For the repository, please create a `README.md` file following [this README template](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohwyy_proj_template).

<!-- and present a visual [elevator speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) using one [Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eQKSdFHNGMDqGJMY4d-yGnNm4UrUj5kIS2mLQGPMZC8/edit#slide=id.p),  -->

We've scheduled part of Day 1 for project ideation and the morning of Day 2 for setting up Slack channels and GitHub repositories. After that, time not allocated to shared tutorials and discussions may be devoted to working on the projects - hacking!

Please look over the information below for guidance about projects, how to get started and the motivations for working on projects.
