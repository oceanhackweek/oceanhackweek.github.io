# OceanHackWeek Fellows Program

Are you interested in helping at the OceanHackWeek workshop? Would you like to host your own OceanHackWeek style event? Then the OceanHackWeek Fellows Program is for you!

Through this program, fellows will learn about all aspects of organizing an OceanHackWeek (OHW) workshop, from logistics to curriculum planning. 
Fellows will be immersed in the OHW philosophy and help support our mission to meet, collaborate, and learn at the intersection of ocean and data sciences. 
After this program, fellows will be equipped to host their own OHW style events.

## OHW Fellows Program Requirements

1. Join, attend and actively engage in the Organizing Committee for the annual OHW Workshop. 
The committee typically meets once a week, but many tasks are carried out by subgroups of the main committee asynchronously from the main Organizing Committee meetings.

2. Attend the annual OHW workshop and join as a project mentor, assist with logistics support, deliver a tutorial and/or assist with any other organizational matters that arise during the workshop.

3. Meet with the OHW Steering Committee after the annual OHW workshop to discuss lessons learned and future directions.
