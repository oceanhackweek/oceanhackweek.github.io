# Logistics Overview

OHW25 will be in person in Seattle, Washington at the University of Washington. We are committed to providing an engaging and full experience for everyone and will strive to facilitate cross communication and collaboration across all participants.

## Time

OceanHackWeek 2025 will take place August 18-22.  The in-person participants will be engaged in OceanHackWeek throughout the day.

**Detailed schedule is available on the [Schedule page](../schedule.md).**


## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *info@oceanhackweek.org*.

[Go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
