            <h2>2018 Participant Quotes</h2>
            <p><i>"The workshop provided an excellent introduction to the existing infrastructure of oceanographic data-gathering resources. Also provided was an introduction to the open-source evolving tools for accessing and utilizing large data sets. The technical challenges in data-intensive research are daunting, and here this workshopâ€™s model and enactment of collaborative work was particularly valuable to me."</i> ~ Rachel Jackson, San Francisco State University</p>
            <p><i>"I am grateful to have attended Oceanhackweek, and to have been given the opportunity to expand my skill set in such a productive and pleasant environment. I live in Fairbanks, AK, where we are rather isolated and aren't naturally exposed to new tools or methods. [...] Oceanhackweek gave me that time, introduced me to possibilities via the tutorials, and through the projects produced a technical structure that I can apply to our research in Alaska."</i> ~ Liz Dobbins, University of Alaska, Fairbanks</p>
            <p><i>"It is sometimes hard to predict whether a given conference, training or hack-a-thon might be worth your time. [...] The real challenge, of course, is to find a group of like minded people that want to expand their horizons and learn together, and that is just what I found when I attended Ocean Hackweek." </i> ~ Christian Saranson</p>
