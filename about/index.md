# About

```{epigraph}
**OUR MISSION** is to meet, collaborate, and learn at the intersection of ocean and data sciences. We create vibrant, diverse, and inclusive communities that push the future of open science.
```

OceanHackWeek (OHW) is a 5-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring,
creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for
large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking.

Its objectives are to:

- Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
- Facilitate inclusive community building: Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate an open science and a sharing culture.

## What is a HackWeek?

[The hackweek model](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717196115) has emerged in the data
science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research
and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows.
In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive
and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art
methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment.
Compared to hackathons typically focused on software development, hackweeks have a greater 
focus on learning and open-ended projects as informal education and peer learning opportunities.
This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific
knowledge but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas
and make discovery.

This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research
where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.
The hackweek model was spearheaded by the successful [*Astro-*](http://astrohackweek.org),
[*Neuro-*](https://neurohackweek.github.io), and [*Geohackweek*](https://geohackweek.github.io).
