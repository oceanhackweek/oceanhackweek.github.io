Are you interested in learning more about OceanHackWeek, helping out with the next event, or learning about the next event and how to prepare a strong application? You can:

- Look over this web site, both general pages and [past events](pasthackweeks)
- Sign up for our email list below
- Write to us at [info@oceanhackweek.org](mailto:info@oceanhackweek.org).
- Post a comment or question on the [OceanHackWeek GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/oceanhackweek/discussions) to engage a larger fraction of the OceanHackWeek community
- Look up our [FAQ for Applicants](../ohw22/applicants.md#faqs). Most of the FAQ entries are relevant for most years, but bear in mind that we update the FAQ every year to reflect the event being planned.

## Mailing list

Sign up for our email announcements list to stay in touch. This is also the best way to know when we are planning an event and open applications.

We send out only a few emails a year, mainly as we're planning our next event, as we are also suffering from overflowing inbox syndrome.
