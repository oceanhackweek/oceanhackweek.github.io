# Logistics Overview

Some of you will participate in person at various satellite events, and others will participate virtually from time zones all over the world. As we have learned throughout the pandemic, each of these gathering styles has strengths and weaknesses. We are committed to providing an engaging and full experience for everyone and will strive to facilitate cross communication and collaboration across all participants.

## Time

OceanHackWeek 2021 will take place August 15-19.

**In-person participants** will gather as for times as directed by the satellite organizers. While **virtual participants** may choose to engage primarily with this group and schedule via Zoom and Slack, we strongly encourage you to join the program designed specifically as a virtual event. The virtual event will be split into two schedules and groups based on the distribution of participant time zones, in a 3-hour daily block of formal, live activities. The **larger virtual event** will take place 11:00am - 2:00pm PDT / 18:00 - 21:00 UTC.

Detailed schedules are available [Schedule page](../schedule.md).

## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *oceanhkw@uw.edu*.

[Go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
