# OHW22 Regional Satellite Events

Six Regional Satellite Events will take place this year to serve as local connecting points for project work, community building, and engaging potential future OHW organizers. [OHW22 organizers](organizers) invite participants geographically located near one of these regional satellites or interested in virtual participation in a specific satellite to select one of these events. The satellite events may be virtual or in-person and take different formats depending on the event organizers. In-person participants may be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Global and satellite participants will have access to the same online resources and common communication channels, and are encouraged to interact one another across time zones and geographical locations especially on project work.

Some satellite events have funding available to support regional travel to the meeting site, while others do not or aim for hosting hybrid meetings. Please check each satellite page for detail. Note that funding request is _not_ part of the application process. Funding-related information will be provided by the satellite organizers after participants are accepted into the events.

We will have two sub-programs in the US Northwest satellite:
- A regular 5-day OHW satellite (August 15-19) geared toward students and scientists already conducting research in the ocean sciences domain
- A 3-week undergraduate summer program (August 8-26) geared toward students who do not already have experiences in oceanographic research and are interested in "testing the water."

These two sub-programs are coordinated in their planning and coincides in time. Participatns are encouraged to interact fully across the groups and with other satellites.
