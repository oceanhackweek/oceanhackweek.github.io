# Tutorials

We are pleased to present a number of tutorials during the week.  These tutorials provide a look into the work that your colleagues pursue using coding tools.  The software for most tutorials can be downloaded using the tools described in our [Tutorials Getting Started page](../tutorials_getting_started.md).  Please check the [schedule](../schedule.md) for the times of these presentations.

```{admonition} Technical preparations and background for OceanHackWeek!
- Please review the ["Preparation" materials](../../resources/prep/index.md) covering basic topics like `Git`, `GitHub`, `conda` package management and the OHW `JupyterHub`
- For tutorials on Python and R scientific tools and techniques that we will use in OceanHackWeek, see the [OHW 2022 tutorials page](../../ohw22/tutorials-index/index.md)!
```

## Main tutorials

<!-- ```{admonition} UPDATE THIS INFORMATION TO OHW24 CONTEXT!!
:class: important
- See the [ohw23 tutorials index page](../../ohw23/tutorials-index) as a template to content for this page. 
- Make sure to update the links to tutorials in `ohw-tutorials` repo in `toctree`, and see [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/issues/263](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/issues/263) to understand the somewhat complex, git submodules set up that links to tutorials in that repo
``` -->

The following tutorials will be presented live during the **US sessions**, and will be recorded for later review.

### Monday, August 26th

[Christian Sarason](https://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Sarason&first_name=Christian) - [**Fight the dreaded 'It works for me' demon with conda package management and jupyter notebooks:**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/00-Mon#packagesjupyterlabhub) This tutorial will describe some of the pros, cons and pitfalls of package management and take quick tour of Pixi and JupyterLab using an example project.


### Tuesday, August 27th

[Derya Gumustel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derya-gumustel) - [**Git&GitHub Primer**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/01-Tue#git--github-primer)

[Callum Rollo](https://callumrollo.github.io/) - [**Data Access in Python:**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/01-Tue#data-access-in-python) In this tutorial, participants will use Python to find and access ocean data via a range of protocols including ERDDAP, OPeNDAP and WMS. 

[Rich Signell](https://opensciencecomputing.com/) - [**Xarray Tutorial**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/01-Tue#xarray) 

[Ciara Dorsay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciara-dorsay/) - [**Assessing weather model skill during extreme events:** NOAA GFS vs. Sofar Spotter buoy observations of Hurricane Henri:](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/01-Tue#assessing-weather-model-skill-during-extreme-events-noaa-gfs-vs-sofar-spotter-buoy-observations-of-hurricane-henri) In this tutorial, participants will learn how to query data of different formats (point-wise buoy, gridded weather model) from Amazon's S3 cloud object storage system, collocate the two, and calculate and visualize the differences between them during a notable weather event using Python.

### Wednesday, August 28th

[Myranda Shirk](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/person/myranda-uselton-shirk/?type=lab) - [**AI-Assisted Programming:**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/02-Wed#ai-assisted-programming) With the recent success of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, mastery of a programming language is no longer required to write successful code. In this tutorial, we will explore the new workflow of AI-assisted programming and how it can streamline your hackathon project, no matter your coding experience.

[Jiarui Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiarui-yu-0b0ab522b/) - [**Introduction to Transformers:**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/02-Wed#deep-learning-introduction-to-transformers) This tutorial includes Transformer’s encoder structure in detail, presenting attention mechanism and transforming the encoder to VIT in order to process 2-d image classification. 

### Thursday, August 29th
[Camille Ross](https://www.neaq.org/person/camille-ross/) - [**Species distribution modeling in R**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/03-Thr)


## Lectures and Discussions

Finally, each year we offer brief sessions on non-coding aspects of computational oceanography; this year we are pleased to offer the following.

- [Eli Holmes](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/elizabeth-holmes-phd) - [**Reproducible Collaboration**](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-tutorials/tree/OHW24/us/00-Mon#reproducible-research)
- [Myranda Shirk](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/person/myranda-uselton-shirk/?type=lab)  - **AI use-case discussion** following a tutorial on AI-Assisted Programming.
