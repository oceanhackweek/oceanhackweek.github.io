## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *info@oceanhackweek.org*.

[Go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
